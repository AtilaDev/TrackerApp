## TrackerApp

This is only a practice with React Native using only TypeScript, react-native-maps, react-native-geolocation and react-native-permissions.

### Important Notes

I put focus only on iOS platform, I mean I didn't install vector icons on Android and any additional lib for the last platform.

If you want to try it on Android, You'll have to follow installation instructions from each libs.
